Background
Water level monitoring is a critical function carried out by the Central Water Commission (CWC) to manage India’s rivers, reservoirs, and flood control infrastructure. Currently, river levels are recorded manually, with staff physically observing and recording the water levels. This process involves taking hourly readings, including during the night.

With the increasing frequency of climate-driven flood events and the importance of real-time hydrological data, there is a growing need to modernize the water level monitoring infrastructure. Leveraging GSM technology, which has widespread coverage even in rural and remote areas, offers a practical solution for remote, automated, and real-time data transmission.

Description
At present, water level data at CWC sites is captured hourly, mostly manually by reading the gauge posts. Most of the sites are located in remote areas. These hourly water levels are useful for predicting flood levels in rivers as well as inflows into reservoirs.

The challenge is to develop a low-cost, energy-efficient GSM-based portable hardware system that:
Transmits data in real-time to central servers or cloud platforms via GSM.
Functions autonomously in remote environments with minimal human intervention.

This system would help in continuous monitoring, enabling faster and more accurate responses to changing water conditions.

Expected solution
There is a need for a floating sensor-based automatic water level reading device.
A GSM/GPRS module (e.g., SIM800/900) should be used to transmit readings to a central server, cloud platform, or API endpoint.
The system should support periodic data transmission and emergency alerts.
A setup with battery backup is required to ensure continuous operation under field conditions.
The sensors should be compact robust and unaffected by submergence conditions.
The device should have a weatherproof and rugged casing suitable for outdoor installation.
A vandal-resistant design is necessary for use in public or remote areas.
SMS alerts should be sent to authorities indicating hourly water levels.
The system should include local data logging to store readings in case of GSM failure.



this is the project that we are trying to do
  (PLEASE ANALYSE THE IMAGE)
AT POINT Z YOU HAVE A BOY ANT DEVICE THT FLOATS ON WATER AD HAS A TRANSMITTER THT IS ALWAYS POINTING TOWARDS X (THUS ACTING LIKE A TANGENT)
AT POINT X YOU HAVE AN ANCHOR + RECEIVER SYSTEM

X TO Y IS THE RIVER LEVEL THT WE NEED TO MONITOR AND FIND OUT EXACTLY USING THE ANGLE BETWEEN C AND A
AND THE LENGTH A 



NOW THE PROBLEM IS HOW DO I KEEP THE TENSION BETWEEN THE X AND Z CONSTANT SO THT 
THE DISTANCE X AND Z IS PERFECTLY STRAINGT?

DO NOTE FOR THE X AND Z DISTANCE I AM USING A FISHING NET ROPE 
AND DO NOTE THT THE XY EDGE IS THE PERPENDICULAR FROM THE ANCHOR THUS ALLOWING US TO ACCURATELY CALCULATE THE ANGLE OF DEVIATION THUS FURHTER ALLOWING US TO FIND OUT THE LENGHT OF XY
