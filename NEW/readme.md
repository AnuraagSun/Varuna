Background
Water level monitoring is a critical function carried out by the Central Water Commission (CWC) to manage India’s rivers, reservoirs, and flood control infrastructure. Currently, river levels are recorded manually, with staff physically observing and recording the water levels. This process involves taking hourly readings, including during the night.

With the increasing frequency of climate-driven flood events and the importance of real-time hydrological data, there is a growing need to modernize the water level monitoring infrastructure. Leveraging GSM technology, which has widespread coverage even in rural and remote areas, offers a practical solution for remote, automated, and real-time data transmission.

Description
At present, water level data at CWC sites is captured hourly, mostly manually by reading the gauge posts. Most of the sites are located in remote areas. These hourly water levels are useful for predicting flood levels in rivers as well as inflows into reservoirs.

The challenge is to develop a low-cost, energy-efficient GSM-based portable hardware system that:
Transmits data in real-time to central servers or cloud platforms via GSM.
Functions autonomously in remote environments with minimal human intervention.

This system would help in continuous monitoring, enabling faster and more accurate responses to changing water conditions.

Expected solution
There is a need for a floating sensor-based automatic water level reading device.
A GSM/GPRS module (e.g., SIM800/900) should be used to transmit readings to a central server, cloud platform, or API endpoint.
The system should support periodic data transmission and emergency alerts.
A setup with battery backup is required to ensure continuous operation under field conditions.
The sensors should be compact robust and unaffected by submergence conditions.
The device should have a weatherproof and rugged casing suitable for outdoor installation.
A vandal-resistant design is necessary for use in public or remote areas.
SMS alerts should be sent to authorities indicating hourly water levels.
The system should include local data logging to store readings in case of GSM failure.

NOW the problem is 
Imagine the depth being 400 cm from the surface of the water 
if i were to use this method then tht means tht the bouy will float away and deviate FAR OFF
from the original point

(since the river currents hit the bouy the bouy will keep on moving to the right more and more and more )


how can i limit this and calculate the exact water level?
